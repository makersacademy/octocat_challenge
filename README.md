Tasks:
--------

**Part 1**

* Create a new repository on Github to store a list of test questions for this test. Call the repository "Octocat".
* Clone it locally into your dev folder making sure you don't get unnecessary double nesting, e.g. ~/projects/repo_name/repo_name/repo_files
* Create one file for each of the following questions on the master branch. Put each question (not answer) in its own file.
  * Explain what git clone does, in your own words
  * Explain what the "upstream" remote is usually used for, in your own words
  * Explain what a branch is, in your own words
* Do a commit after you create each file
* Create a new branch "answers"
* Update the files, replacing the questions with answers.
* Do a commit after you write each answer
* Make sure both branches are pushed back to github

**Part 2**
